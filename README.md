Function Compute Resources
==========================

This repository holds example code and other resources related to Alibaba Cloud's [Function Compute](). The code here is written and maintained by the [Alibaba Cloud Academy]() team. We are Alibaba Cloud's educators and we strive to make Alibaba Cloud simpler to understand! Feel free to reach out to us via our [Twitter](https://twitter.com/cloud_alibaba) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/alibaba-cloud-academy) accounts!

Each of the subdirectories here holds a specific Function Compute example from one of our lectures or online courses. Don't worry: we include a README in each subdirectory that explains in more detail what the code does and how it should be run.

Happy Learning!
